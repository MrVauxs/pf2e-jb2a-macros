A collection of JB2A macros for the PF2e Foundry system.

Created to accompany the Community Complete Autorec for [Automated Animations](https://github.com/otigon/automated-jb2a-animations).

**Requires JB2A Assets modules. Built primarily for the _Patreon_ version.** Full compatibility with the Free version is on the To-Do list, but not a priority.

You can probably appropriate most of this module for other systems, I simply don't have interest in doing so.

If you want to support me, you can tip me over on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mrvauxs)!

#### Advanced Macros?
Until [this feature](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/7184) is implemented, it's a necessary part of the module.
